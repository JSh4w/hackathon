   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```env
   RAIL_EMAIL=your_hsp_email@domain.com
   RAIL_PWORD=your_hsp_password
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```
   Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Start the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Journey Analysis
1. Select your departure and arrival stations (use 3-letter station codes)
2. Choose your time window and travel days
3. Select date range (recent data or historical)
4. Click "Analyze" to generate performance insights

### Understanding the Results
- **Departure Performance**: Shows delay distribution for departures from origin station
- **Arrival Performance**: Shows delay distribution for arrivals at destination station
- **On-Time Performance**: Percentage of services within ¬±1 minute of schedule
- **Reliability Score**: Overall service reliability percentage

### Station Codes
Use standard UK railway station codes (CRS codes):
- `EUS` - London Euston
- `KGL` - Kings Langley
- `BTN` - Brighton
- `VIC` - London Victoria
- And many more...
